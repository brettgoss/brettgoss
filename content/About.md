## About Brett Goss
My name is Brett Goss. I used to make coffee, and now I write code.

I graduated in December of 2016 from Lighthouse Labs' Web Dev Bootcamp, and I have been working since January for a small agency in Victoria, BC called [PurposeSocial](http://purposesocial.com). Through them, I have worked on a number of projects, most notably a complete site rebuild for [Sitka Surf Co](https://sitka.ca).

I'm passionate about learning, whether technical or not, and if I'm not at work you'll probably find me either tinkering with my car or travelling around BC.
