My name is Brett Goss. I used to make coffee, and now I write code.

I graduated from [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca) in December of 2016, and spent the next six months working for an agency in Victoria, BC called [PurposeSocial](https://purposesocial.com). During that time, I worked primarily with [Sitka Surf Co.](https://sitka.ca) to rebuild their online Shopify Store, with a focus on both mobile and desktop usability, as well as improving conversions.

I have more side projects than I'd like to admit - the most notable of which is [Plantia](http://plantia.io): a web app for keeping track of your houseplants' watering schedules. If you want to check out my code behind the scenes, here are Github links to [Plantia](https://github.com/Plantia/plantia-web), and of course [my own profile](https://github.com/brettgoss).
